👋 Hi, I’m @CodeTarik
I am passionate about technical things. Anything related to technology fascinates me. 
Since I come from a technical background myself, I am particularly excited about electrical engineering and creating things in general. I enjoy working on projects that can be useful to people.

🌱 I am currently learning JavaScript, Angular, API, and database querying.
💞️ I am currently transitioning into a programming career and undergoing training in JavaScript, Angular, API development, and database querying.
